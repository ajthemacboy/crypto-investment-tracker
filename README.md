# Cryptocurrency Investment Tracker
Simple pinabble cryptocurrency investment tracker window, written with PyQt5.

Saves Original Price and Holdings values to a config file on close, and loads them on launch.

I wanted a simple program I could leave running in the corner of my screen to track when I (as someone very far from a professional investor) should buy and sell my BTC.
